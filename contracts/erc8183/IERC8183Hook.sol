/**
 * @title IERC8183Hook
 * @dev Interface for ERC-8183 hook contracts. Implementations receive before/after
 *      callbacks on core job functions.
 *
 *      The `selector` identifies which core function is being called (e.g.
 *      ERC8183.fund.selector). The `data` parameter contains
 *      function-specific parameters encoded as bytes (see documentation for
 *      encoding per selector).
 *
 *      This interface is intentionally minimal (two functions) so that it remains
 *      stable as the core protocol evolves — new hookable functions simply produce
 *      new selector values without changing this interface.
 *
 *      For convenience, inherit from BaseERC8183Hook which routes selectors to named
 *      virtual functions (e.g. _preFund, _postComplete) so you only override
 *      what you need.
